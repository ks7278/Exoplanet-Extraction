# Exoplanet-Extraction
Discovering exoplanets using the data provided by kepler telescope.
# 
This project is about extracting exoplanet data from the Kepler dataset using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter notebook is written in Python and uses various libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The notebook includes the necessary code to preprocess the dataset, apply a machine learning algorithm, and evaluate the results. The goal is to classify exoplanets into two categories: confirmed and false positives. The notebook provides a detailed explanation of each step in the process, along with visualizations of the data and model performance.
